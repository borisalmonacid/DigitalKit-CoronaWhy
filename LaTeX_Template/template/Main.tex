% Create a new command for each orcid.
% To create a new command, the following command must be used:
% \newcommand{\orcidauthorXY}{0000-0000-000-0000}
% Where X and Y is a letter between A and Z. Altogether the value for X and Y must be different for each author, since it corresponds to an identifier.

% Example:

% Author 1, uses the identifier AA.
\newcommand{\orcidauthorAA}{0000-0000-000-0000}
% Author 2, uses the identifier AB.
\newcommand{\orcidauthorAB}{0000-0000-000-0000}

% To be able to call this command, you must use the script \orcidXY{}
